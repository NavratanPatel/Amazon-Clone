# Amazon Clone 
![20230826_013741](https://github.com/NavratanPatel/Amazon-Clone/assets/90257430/d512f3c1-f988-4301-afd6-0aea7a03d04a)

## Description
- I've created an Amazon clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exclusively.
- JavaScript is used for sliding hero section and menu bar functionality, while the layout and styling are achieved through HTML and CSS. 
- The project features two navigation bars at the top, 
  a dynamic Hero Section with changing slides, organized category displays, a section for special deals, and an Amazon-style footer.
  I've also included hover effects and utilized CSS animations for the menu bar button.
